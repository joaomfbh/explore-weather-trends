# Explore Weather trends

This jupyter notebook file is a evolution from the original project submitted, that was builded in Excel. My goal is to create the code as I learned the data analysis techniques in Python.

The dataset available (weather_trends.csv) was gathered through the sql workspace provided by Udacity. You'll found data like year, city, country, city average temperature and global average temperature. The city is Belo Horizonte, from Brazil because is where i live. The years is from 1832 to 2013 where:

- The five initital years (1832 to 1837) were droped because the moving average is calculated starting in year 1838;
- The years 1844 to 1850 don't exists in the dataset don't know why;
- The unit for temperature is Celsius (CÂ°).

The final goal is visualize the plot for the Belo Horizonte moving average temperature compared with Global moving average temperature.
